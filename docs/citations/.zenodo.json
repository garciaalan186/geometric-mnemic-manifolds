  "title": "Geometric Mnemic Manifolds: A Position Paper - Toward Structured Memory Architectures for Persistent AI Agency",
  "description": "A position paper presenting the Geometric Mnemic Manifold (GMM), a proposed memory architecture for large language models with formal complexity proofs, honest assessment of claims, and a concrete validation roadmap. This work distinguishes proven mathematical properties from conjectures, identifies critical validation gates, and frames GMM as a research agenda rather than a proven solution. Version 3.0 emphasizes epistemic clarity, corrects overclaimed complexity bounds, and provides a four-phase experimental roadmap for empirical validation.",
