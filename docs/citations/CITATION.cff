abstract: >-
  A novel architecture for simulating the functional dynamics of
  autonoetic memory in AI systems. This system departs from the
  industry standard of stochastic Vector Databases by introducing
  the Geometric Mnemic Manifold, where a Recursive Reasoning Kernel
  (RRK) acts as a fluid reasoning engine, offloading long-term memory
  to a distributed graph of immutable Engrams. The architecture
  organizes engrams along a deterministic, low-discrepancy trajectory
  utilizing Kronecker sequences on the hypersphere, achieving O(1)
  constant-time addressing and O(log N) semantic traversal while
  eliminating the "Cold Start" latency problem inherent in graph-based
  indexing.
